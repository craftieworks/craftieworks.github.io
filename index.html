            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="p-5">
                The total fertility rate is the number of children that would be born to the average woman if she were to continue having children until the end of her childbearing years and do so at the current age-specific fertility rates.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center"><img src="assets/fertility-world.png" alt="A graph showing ferility rate in the world" class="img-fluid"></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" class="p-5">
                According to the figure, the global average fertility rate is around 1.5~2 children per woman today (except Africa). However, during much of our history, the average woman had at least five children, and sometimes even more. The number fluctuated throughout time, and there were notable disparities between nations. The fluctuate and differentiation of fertility rate within different country are due to the varied culture in different country. This is because people don't simply have the children they do because of their own pursuit of happiness, financial gain, or simple biology; rather, it's because of the way that culture and value systems have shaped their behaviors. <br>
                This passage will discuss the how does culture affect people’s concept of fertility in different nations and continents (include China, Africa, America, and India). We will do this by evaluating the fertility rate, the tradition, people’s consciousness, and some other external and internal factor in different regions.

                        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fs-1">C</span>hina is a country with a long-standing traditional culture and this culture has had a profound impact on all aspects of the country, including fertility rates. The traditional culture of family, Confucianism and moral values have all influenced the fertility attitudes and behaviours of the Chinese people to some extent. The most recent census put the total population of the country at 141,178,000 in 2021. This is an increase of 72.06 million people or an average annual growth rate of 0.53% compared to 133.97 million people in 2010. This represents an era of low growth for China's population, which has declined even more in the last two years.</p>

                            <span class="fs-1">F</span>irstly, the family concept in traditional Chinese culture places great importance on the importance of children, especially the value of sons. In some extreme traditional families, sons can inherit the family business and continue the family legacy, while daughters are often seen as 'money losers'. This grossly unequal mindset has led some extreme traditional families to place an overwhelming need for sons at the expense of daughters, and even to force women to have multiple pregnancies and deliveries until they have a son before they can stop being pregnant. According to the 2019 data the most imbalanced age groups for the sex ratio between men and women in China are 10-14 years old (119.10) and 15-19 years old (118.39), but in the absence of artificial interference the sex ratio at birth should be relatively stable, with variations ranging from 103 to 107. The number of men and women in the marriageable age population will be roughly equal. If the sex ratio at birth is chronically, consistently and significantly above 107, it is a very abnormal phenomenon, suggesting the existence of artificial foetal sex selection, a bias that has a negative impact on China's fertility rate. In contrast, the data from the seventh census show a sex ratio of (115.03) for males and females aged 10 to 14 and (116.13) for males and females aged 15 to 19, which has begun to gradually decline compared to the 2019 data, which is a good sign and proves that traditional culture and bad habits have become less and less influential on people.

                            <span class="fs-1">S</span>econdly, Confucianism, a traditional Chinese culture, has also influenced the Chinese people's perception of fertility. Confucianism emphasises the importance of the family, especially the responsibilities and duties of both men and women, and the idea that having children is part of family responsibility. This thinking has prompted the Chinese to place importance on childbearing in marriage and family in order to assume their own family responsibilities and duties. Young couples naturally consider the marginal costs and benefits of having a child when considering whether to have and raise a child, but as society develops from an agrarian to an industrial society, the ratio of marginal benefits to marginal costs of having a child is decreasing. With this comes a decline in fertility, and the Confucian concept of the family has become less and less influential on the youth of today as time progresses.

                            <span class="fs-1">F</span>inally, the moral values of traditional Chinese culture have also had an impact on fertility rates. Traditional Chinese moral values emphasise the importance of "marriage for men and marriage for women" and encourage people to marry and have children at a young age. In addition, traditional moral values also emphasise the importance of having many children, believing that having more children will bring more blessings to the family. All these concepts have influenced the Chinese people's perception of fertility. In traditional agrarian societies, having more children meant a rise in the most substantial labour force, and it was clearly not worthwhile to devote the energy of raising two children to raising one, so there was a greater tendency to have more children, so that before 1974, the average Chinese woman would have four to five children, and in 1963 even the average Chinese woman would have seven to eight children. In modern times, however, if the strategy of having more children and raising them at a lower level is continued, it will not actually bring about an apparent change in the family situation, but by concentrating on raising one or two quality children through eugenics, it will still be possible to make the class leap through the Gao Kao and, because the current state of the Chinese population in the 1970s and 1980s was characterised by a large population base but low quality. To address the range of implications of overpopulation, the state introduced the one-child policy. Between 1979 and 2016, increasingly fierce social competition and the exposure of the people to new ideas led them to gradually begin to break free from traditional ideas and to choose the number of children they would have based on their personal and social realities.

                        <span class="fs-1">I</span>n conclusion, traditional culture is an important part of Chinese history and its influence on fertility cannot be ignored. By gaining a deeper understanding of the influence of traditional culture on fertility attitudes and behaviours, we can better understand the fertility attitudes and behaviours of Chinese people today and develop more effective policies to promote healthy population development.
